# How We Use GitHub Issues and Projects at Blu-H

Blu-H uses GitHub **Issues** and **Projects** together to support transparent thinking
and effective coordination, while respecting the need for privacy in some operational
contexts.

This note explains how each is used, and how visibility works in practice.

---

## Issues and Projects: Different Purposes

### GitHub Issues
Issues are used as a **thinking, discussion, and proposal space**.

They help to:
- Surface questions and ideas early
- Capture context and rationale
- Enable shared understanding
- Avoid private, undocumented decision-making

An Issue does **not** imply approval, priority, or commitment.

---

### GitHub Projects
Projects are used for **planning, tracking, and coordination**.

They help to:
- Organise work that is underway or expected
- Track progress across multiple topics
- Coordinate activities that may not be public

Projects are often **private**, even when Issues are public.

---

## Visibility: How It Actually Works

### Public vs Private Issues
- An **Issue created in a public repository is public**
- An **Issue created in a private repository is private**

Projects do not change the visibility of an Issue.

---

### Issues Added to Private Projects

If a **public Issue** is added to a **private Project**:

- ✅ The Issue itself remains **public**
- ❌ The Project board, notes, and internal context remain **private**
- ❌ Any private fields, comments, or prioritisation in the Project are not visible

In other words:
> **Projects do not make Issues private.  
> They only control who can see the planning around them.**

---

### Why We Do This

This approach allows Blu-H to:
- Keep questions and proposals visible where appropriate
- Avoid exposing internal planning, sequencing, or sensitivities
- Balance transparency with operational responsibility
- Support trust with partners, donors, and communities

---

## When to Use an Issue

Open an Issue when:
- A topic needs discussion or shared thinking
- A proposal is exploratory
- Context should be visible beyond a small group
- A question may inform future decisions

Examples:
- “Exploring paid membership levels”
- “When should safeguarding move from draft?”
- “Criteria for moving a pilot forward”

---

## When to Use a Project

Use a Project when:
- Work is being actively coordinated
- Multiple tasks or threads need tracking
- Timing, ownership, or sequencing matters
- Some context should remain private

Projects are about **execution**, not decisions.

---

## From Issues to Projects (and Back)

- An Issue may exist without ever entering a Project
- Some Issues may later be added to a Project for tracking
- Many Issues will be closed after discussion without further action

This is normal and expected.

---

## From Issues to Decisions

If an Issue leads to a **governance-level decision**:
- The decision is recorded in the Decision Log
- The Issue may be closed with a brief summary

Issues support thinking; decisions live elsewhere.

---

## Tone and Etiquette

We aim to:
- Use Issues to clarify, not to pressure
- Keep discussion constructive and proportionate
- Avoid assuming outcomes
- Respect that not all topics are ready for action

---

## Summary

- **Issues** = thinking, discussion, proposals (often public)
- **Projects** = planning and coordination (often private)
- **Adding an Issue to a private Project does not make it private**
- **Decisions are recorded separately**

This approach may evolve as Blu-H grows.
