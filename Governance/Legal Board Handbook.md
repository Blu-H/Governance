# Legal Board Handbook
**Organisation:** Blu-H ASBL (Luxembourg)  
**Status:** DRAFT  
**Applies to:** Legal Board of Directors; Secretary; Treasurer; President; Executive Director (where invited); advisors/committees (where applicable)  
**Owner:** Legal Board  
**Effective date:** (date)  
**Last updated:** (date)

## 1. Purpose
This handbook defines how the Legal Board operates in practice: meeting cadence, decision-making, use of the General Assembly (GA) and Annual General Meeting (AGM), and document control (including how GitHub is used). It exists to ensure:
- consistent and lawful governance,
- a clear, repeatable board cycle,
- reliable audit-ready records (minutes, resolutions, approvals),
- controlled documents and a clear “system of record”.

This handbook supports (and does not replace) Blu-H’s Statutes and any Board-adopted policies (e.g., Delegation of Authority, Financial Controls, COI, Donation Acceptance, Safeguarding, Data Integrity).

---

## 2. Governance Structure: GA, AGM, and the Legal Board
### 2.1 General Assembly (GA)
The GA is the membership body. It holds reserved powers as set out in the Statutes and applicable law. Typical GA matters include:
- approval of statutory changes (Statutes/Articles),
- appointment/confirmation of directors where required,
- review/approval of annual accounts where required,
- any other matters reserved to the GA by Statutes/law.

### 2.2 Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The AGM is the annual ordinary meeting of the GA. It typically:
- receives the annual activity report,
- reviews financial results and annual accounts (as applicable),
- addresses governance items (Board composition, major changes),
- approves any resolutions that must be taken by the GA.

### 2.3 Legal Board of Directors
The Legal Board is responsible for governance and fiduciary oversight, including:
- approving strategy, budgets, projects, and key policies,
- overseeing risk, compliance, and integrity,
- ensuring proper recordkeeping and statutory compliance,
- supervising delegated management (ED and staff) through reporting and controls.

---

## 3. Roles and Role Documents
This handbook defines **process**. Detailed officer duties should be in a separate controlled document:
- **Roles & Officer Terms of Reference (ToR)** (President, Treasurer, Secretary, and any others).

**Rule:** If there is any conflict between the Statutes, a Board resolution, and the ToR, the **Statutes and formal resolutions prevail**.

---

## 4. Meeting Cadence and Governance Calendar
### 4.1 Standard cadence
- **Regular Board meetings:** at least **quarterly** (recommended **monthly** during start-up / operating build-out).
- **Extraordinary Board meetings:** as needed for urgent matters (contracts, incidents, time-sensitive approvals).
- **AGM:** once per year (date per Statutes/GA notice rules).

### 4.2 Annual governance calendar (recommended)
- **Q1:** approve annual operating budget; confirm policy review plan; risk review.
- **Q2:** mid-year budget review; project portfolio review; compliance check.
- **Q3:** AGM preparation; Board composition review; fundraising and partnership review.
- **Q4:** annual close planning; next-year priorities; approve annual reporting pack draft.

---

## 5. Meeting Preparation and Board Packs
### 5.1 Agenda
The President and Secretary set the agenda (with ED input where relevant). Standard agenda items:
- quorum and attendance
- conflict of interest declarations
- approval of prior minutes
- action tracker review
- finance (budget vs actuals; cash position; risks)
- projects/programme updates
- governance/policy approvals
- decisions/resolutions
- AOB and close

### 5.2 Board pack timing (recommended)
- Circulate agenda + pack at least **7 days** before a regular meeting.
- For extraordinary meetings, circulate as early as possible with a clear deadline.

### 5.3 Pack contents (minimum)
- draft agenda
- previous minutes + decision log extract
- action tracker
- finance snapshot (budget vs actuals; cash; restricted funds summary if applicable)
- papers for each decision (proposal + rationale + risks + draft resolution text)

---

## 6. Quorum, Attendance, and Conflicts of Interest
### 6.1 Quorum
Quorum rules are defined by the Statutes. If quorum is not met:
- discussion may occur,
- binding decisions must be deferred unless the Statutes permit otherwise.

### 6.2 Conflicts of Interest (COI)
- COI is a standing agenda item at the start of every meeting.
- Conflicted individuals must not approve their own benefits/expenses and should recuse from discussion/decision where required.
- COI and recusals must be recorded in minutes.

---

## 7. Decision-Making and Voting
### 7.1 Decision types
- **Information item:** no decision required.
- **Decision:** approval within Board authority.
- **Resolution:** formal binding decision with explicit recorded text and vote outcome.

### 7.2 Voting and recording
Voting rules and majorities follow the Statutes. Minutes must record:
- the exact wording of each resolution/decision,
- proposer/seconder (if used),
- votes (for/against/abstain) and outcome.

### 7.3 Written resolutions (between meetings)
Where permitted:
- circulate the exact text with a response deadline,
- collect votes/assents in writing,
- file the final resolution as a controlled record and log it in the decision register.

### 7.4 Reserved matters (non-exhaustive)
These should normally require Board approval (or GA approval if reserved by Statutes/law):
- annual operating budget and material re-forecasting
- new projects, major partnerships, and material scope changes
- adoption/revision of key policies (DoA, Financial Controls, COI, Donation Acceptance, Safeguarding)
- senior appointments and removals (ED/Science Lead where applicable)
- contracts and spend above DoA thresholds
- bank mandates/signatories and major financial changes
- any GA/AGM matters (statute changes, director appointments where reserved, etc.)

---

## 8. Minutes, Action Tracking, and Evidence
### 8.1 Minutes
- Draft minutes prepared by the Secretary within **7–14 days**.
- Minutes approved at the next meeting (or by written approval where needed).
- Once approved, minutes are locked as the official record.

### 8.2 Action tracker
- Each meeting ends with confirmed actions: owner + due date.
- The tracker is reviewed at the start of the next meeting.

### 8.3 Evidence standard
Every decision should be supported by a “decision pack” where appropriate:
- proposal paper, financial impact, risks, and any draft agreements
- evidence of approval (minutes/resolution)
- document links and version references

---

## 9. Document Control and Systems of Record
### 9.1 “System of record” principle
Blu-H must maintain a single authoritative location for **official governance records** (minutes, signed resolutions, final adopted policies, statutory filings evidence). This is the **Governance System of Record** (e.g., a restricted Board & Governance library).

**Rule:** Working drafts may exist elsewhere; only the approved controlled copy in the system of record is authoritative.

### 9.2 How GitHub is used
GitHub is used for:
- source code repositories,
- technical documentation (version-controlled),
- issue tracking for technical work,
- reproducible scientific/engineering artefacts.

GitHub is **not** the system of record for:
- Board minutes and resolutions,
- signed legal documents,
- statutory registers,
- contracts requiring controlled access.

Where useful, governance records may include a link to a GitHub commit/release to reference the technical artefact associated with a Board decision (e.g., approving a release or deployment), but the governance evidence remains in the system of record.

### 9.3 Document status and versioning
Controlled documents must include:
- title, status (Draft/Approved), owner, effective date, last updated, next review
- version number (v1.0, v1.1…)
- approval reference (meeting date + minutes/resolution ID)

### 9.4 Naming conventions (recommended)
- `YYYY-MM-DD_BoardMeeting_Minutes_v1.0.pdf`
- `YYYY-MM-DD_BoardResolution_[Topic]_v1.0.pdf`
- `Policy_[Name]_v1.0.pdf`
- `Decision_Log_vCurrent.xlsx` (or list)

### 9.5 Access controls (minimum)
- Governance records restricted to Legal Board (and explicitly authorised support roles).
- External sharing requires explicit Board approval and must use approved channels.

---

## 10. Registers and Board Governance Toolkit
Minimum Board-controlled registers/logs:
- Decision Log (decisions + resolutions)
- Minutes Register (meeting minutes index)
- COI Register
- Risk Register
- Contracts & Agreements Register
- Donation Register (with restricted-funds flags where applicable)
- Membership Register (Secretary custodian; access controlled)
- Policy Register (list + owners + review dates)

---

## 11. GA/AGM Operations
### 11.1 AGM/GA notice and agenda discipline
- The Secretary ensures notices and agendas comply with Statutes and legal notice periods.
- The AGM agenda should include all items requiring GA action; items not on the agenda should not be voted (unless the Statutes allow).

### 11.2 AGM preparation pack (minimum)
Prepare at least **14–21 days** before AGM (or per Statutes):
- AGM notice and agenda
- annual activity report
- financial pack (accounts, budget summary, restricted funds summary if applicable)
- proposed resolutions (exact text)
- nominations/Board composition items (if applicable)
- prior AGM minutes

### 11.3 AGM outputs
- signed AGM minutes / resolutions
- updated statutory filings evidence (where required)
- updates to registers (directors, members, beneficial owner data, etc.)

---

## 12. Committees and Advisory Inputs
The Board may establish committees or working groups by resolution with written terms of reference:
- scope, membership, chair, reporting cadence
- decision authority (if any) and escalation rules
Committees advise unless explicit delegated authority is granted within lawful limits.

---

## 13. Exceptions and Escalation
Any deviation from this handbook must be:
- documented by the Secretary,
- approved by the President (and Board where material),
- recorded in the next Board meeting minutes.

Serious incidents or suspected misconduct affecting governance integrity must be escalated to the President and Treasurer immediately and placed on the next Board agenda (or handled via extraordinary meeting if urgent).
