# Conflict of Interest Policy

**Status:** Draft – ready for Legal Board review  
**Applies to:** Blu-H ASBL (Luxembourg)  
**Owner:** Legal Board (Board of Directors / Conseil d’administration)  
**Last updated:** 23 December 2025  
**Next review:** 30 June 2026  

---

## Purpose

This policy defines how Blu-H identifies, discloses, manages, and records **actual, potential, or perceived** conflicts of interest.

The objective is to ensure that decisions and actions are taken solely in the best interests of Blu-H and its **public-interest mission**, and are made independently, fairly, and transparently.

---

## Scope

This policy applies to all persons participating in decision-making, influencing decisions, or representing Blu-H, including:

- Members of the **Legal Board** (Board of Directors)  
- Members of the **Advisory Board / Senior Advisors** (non-fiduciary unless separately appointed)  
- **Officers / operations leadership**, management, staff, and contractors  
- **Volunteers, citizen helpers, and contributors**, including in disaster-related contexts  
- Any individual acting on behalf of Blu-H in a governance, advisory, operational, partnership, procurement, or funding role  

---

## Context

Blu-H engages with scientific, humanitarian, academic, public-sector, and private-sector partners. Professional, financial, personal, or advisory relationships may give rise to conflicts of interest.

Blu-H may also operate in **high-risk or disaster-affected contexts**, where conflicts can create safeguarding, power, or exploitation risks. Blu-H applies heightened caution and independent oversight where needed.

---

## Definitions

**Conflict of Interest:** A situation where a person’s private interest could improperly influence (or be perceived to influence) their judgment, decisions, or actions for Blu-H.

Conflicts may be:
- **Actual:** exists now  
- **Potential:** could arise  
- **Perceived:** a reasonable observer could believe a conflict exists  

**Interests include** (non-exhaustive):
- **Financial:** employment, consulting, shareholdings, grants, paid roles, gifts/hospitality, royalties  
- **Non-financial:** personal relationships, close friendships, reputational interests, competing commitments, leadership roles elsewhere  
- **Organisational:** commitments to another organisation whose goals, funding, or activities intersect with Blu-H  

**Related party / related person:** spouse/partner, close family, household members, or entities controlled by the person (or where the person holds a significant role).

---

## Principles

- **Mission first:** decisions must prioritise Blu-H’s purpose and public-interest impact  
- **Transparency:** disclose conflicts early and clearly  
- **Independence:** Blu-H operates with strict political, ideological, and religious independence  
- **Proportionality:** manage conflicts in a practical, risk-based way  
- **Accountability:** decisions and mitigations must be documented in the official record  

---

## Responsibilities

**All covered persons must:**
- Avoid situations where conflicts are likely, where reasonably possible  
- Disclose conflicts promptly (actual, potential, or perceived)  
- Follow recusal and management instructions  
- Update disclosures when circumstances change  

**Legal Board must:**
- Oversee and ensure consistent application of this policy  
- Prevent conflicted participation in decisions where conflicts exist  
- Ensure proper recordkeeping (minutes, register updates, adoption records)  

**Advisory Board / Senior Advisors must:**
- Disclose relevant conflicts relating to advisory work  
- Respect recusal requests and avoid influencing outcomes where conflicted  

---

## Disclosure Requirements

**On appointment / onboarding:**  
All covered persons submit an initial declaration including roles, affiliations, financial interests, and relationships relevant to Blu-H.

**Annual refresh:**  
All covered persons confirm or update their declaration at least annually (even if “no changes”).

**Meeting-by-meeting declarations (Legal Board):**  
A standing agenda item must be included: **“Declarations of interests / conflicts of interest.”**  
Conflicts linked to an agenda item must be declared **before** discussion begins.

---

## Managing Conflicts of Interest

Blu-H uses one or more of the following controls, depending on severity:

1. **Record only (low risk):** declare and document; participation may continue if not material  
2. **Restricted participation:** provide factual information if requested, then withdraw  
3. **Recusal:** withdraw from discussion and do not vote (default for material conflicts)  
4. **Independent review:** non-conflicted individuals assess and recommend  
5. **Alternative decision path:** escalate to Legal Board (or defer) where operations/advisors are conflicted  
6. **Decline / terminate:** if the conflict cannot be mitigated adequately  

**Minimum rule for material conflicts (Legal Board):**  
The conflicted person must not influence the decision, must not vote, and must be recorded as recused in the minutes.

---

## Related-Party Transactions and Benefits

Blu-H should avoid related-party transactions unless mission-justified and strongly safeguarded.

Where a transaction, grant, contract, or material benefit may involve a related party, the Legal Board must ensure:
- Full disclosure and documentation  
- Arm’s-length terms and demonstrable reasonableness  
- Decision by non-conflicted decision-makers  
- Rationale and safeguards recorded in minutes and in the conflict register  

---

## Gifts, Hospitality, and Sponsorships

Covered persons must not accept gifts or hospitality that could influence (or be perceived to influence) decisions.

- Token items may be accepted if culturally appropriate and recorded where relevant  
- Anything above a modest threshold (set by the Legal Board) must be declared  
- Gifts must never be accepted from parties seeking a decision, contract, or preferential access  

---

## Recordkeeping and Transparency

Blu-H maintains a **Conflict of Interest Register** documenting declarations and actions taken.

In line with Blu-H’s transparency-first approach, the **Conflict of Interest Policy** and a **publishable version** of the Conflict of Interest Register will be made available in the Blu-H public governance repository on GitHub, with appropriate redactions and safeguards for personal data and security-sensitive information.

The Legal Board ensures that minutes record:
- What was declared  
- Who was recused  
- What mitigation was applied  
- The decision outcome  

---

## Breaches and Enforcement

Failure to disclose or comply with this policy may result in:
- Removal from a decision-making process  
- Formal warning  
- Suspension or termination of an advisory/volunteer role  
- Escalation to the Legal Board for further action  

Good-faith reporting of concerns will not result in retaliation.

---

## Sign-Off

Approved by the Legal Board on **[YYYY-MM-DD]**.

---

## Next Steps

This policy should be drafted, reviewed, and approved by the Legal Board before Blu-H:
- Receives external funding  
- Enters formal partnerships  
- Procures significant services or technology  
- Appoints additional board or advisory members  
- Expands operations in higher-risk or disaster-affected contexts
