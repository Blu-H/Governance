# Conflict of Interest Policy
**Status:** Draft – ready for Legal Board review  
**Applies to:** Blu-H ASBL (Luxembourg)  
**Owner:** Legal Board (Board of Directors / Conseil d’administration)  
**Last updated:** 2 February 2026  
**Next review:** 30 June 2026  

## Purpose
This policy defines how Blu-H identifies, discloses, manages, and records actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest.

The objective is to ensure that decisions and actions are taken solely in the best interests of Blu-H and its public-interest mission, and are made independently, fairly, and transparently.

## Scope
This policy applies to all persons participating in decision-making, influencing decisions, or representing Blu-H, including:

- Members of the Legal Board (Board of Directors)  
- Members of the Advisory Board / Senior Advisors (non-fiduciary unless separately appointed)  
- Officers / operations leadership, management, staff, and contractors  
- Volunteers, citizen helpers, and contributors, including in disaster-related contexts  
- Any individual acting on behalf of Blu-H in a governance, advisory, operational, partnership, procurement, or funding role  

## Context
Blu-H engages with scientific, humanitarian, academic, public-sector, and private-sector partners. Professional, financial, personal, or advisory relationships may give rise to conflicts of interest.

Blu-H may also operate in high-risk or disaster-affected contexts, where conflicts can create safeguarding, power, or exploitation risks. Blu-H applies heightened caution and independent oversight where needed.

## Definitions
**Conflict of Interest:** A situation where a person’s private interest could improperly influence (or be perceived to influence) their judgment, decisions, or actions for Blu-H.

Conflicts may be:
- **Actual:** exists now  
- **Potential:** could arise  
- **Perceived:** a reasonable observer could believe a conflict exists  

Interests include (non-exhaustive):
- **Financial:** employment, consulting, shareholdings, grants, paid roles, gifts/hospitality, royalties  
- **Non-financial:** personal relationships, close friendships, reputational interests, competing commitments, leadership roles elsewhere  
- **Organisational:** commitments to another organisation whose goals, funding, or activities intersect with Blu-H  

**Related party / related person:** spouse/partner, close family, household members, or entities controlled by the person (or where the person holds a significant role).

## Principles
- **Mission first:** decisions must prioritise Blu-H’s purpose and public-interest impact  
- **Transparency:** disclose conflicts early and clearly  
- **Independence:** Blu-H operates with strict political, ideological, and religious independence  
- **Proportionality:** manage conflicts in a practical, risk-based way  
- **Accountability:** decisions and mitigations must be documented in the official record  

## Responsibilities
### All covered persons must:
- Avoid situations where conflicts are likely, where reasonably possible  
- Disclose conflicts promptly (actual, potential, or perceived)  
- Follow recusal and management instructions  
- Update disclosures when circumstances change  

### Legal Board must:
- Oversee and ensure consistent application of this policy  
- Prevent conflicted participation in decisions where conflicts exist  
- Ensure proper recordkeeping (minutes, register updates, adoption records)  

### Advisory Board / Senior Advisors must:
- Disclose relevant conflicts relating to advisory work  
- Respect recusal requests and avoid influencing outcomes where conflicted  

## Disclosure requirements and timing
### 1) On appointment / onboarding
All covered persons must submit an initial declaration including roles, affiliations, financial interests, and relationships relevant to Blu-H **within 14 calendar days** of appointment/onboarding (or within 14 calendar days of adoption of this policy for existing roles).

### 2) Updates after change
New interests, relationships, or circumstances that could create a conflict must be disclosed and recorded **within 7 calendar days** of any material change.

### 3) Annual refresh
All covered persons confirm or update their declaration at least annually (even if “no changes”).

### 4) Meeting-by-meeting declarations (Legal Board)
A standing agenda item must be included: **“Declarations of interests / conflicts of interest.”**  
Conflicts linked to an agenda item must be declared before discussion begins.

## Managing conflicts of interest
Blu-H uses one or more of the following controls, depending on severity:

- **Record only (low risk):** declare and document; participation may continue if not material  
- **Restricted participation:** provide factual information if requested, then withdraw  
- **Recusal:** withdraw from discussion and do not vote (default for material conflicts)  
- **Independent review:** non-conflicted individuals assess and recommend  
- **Alternative decision path:** escalate to Legal Board (or defer) where operations/advisors are conflicted  
- **Decline / terminate:** if the conflict cannot be mitigated adequately  

### Minimum rule for material conflicts (Legal Board)
The conflicted person **must not influence the decision**, **must not vote**, and must be recorded as **recused** in the minutes.

## Related-party transactions and benefits
Blu-H should avoid related-party transactions unless mission-justified and strongly safeguarded.

Where a transaction, grant, contract, or material benefit may involve a related party, the Legal Board must ensure:
- Full disclosure and documentation  
- Arm’s-length terms and demonstrable reasonableness  
- Decision by non-conflicted decision-makers  
- Rationale and safeguards recorded in minutes and in the conflict register  

## Gifts, hospitality, and sponsorships
Covered persons must not accept gifts or hospitality that could influence (or be perceived to influence) decisions.

- Token items may be accepted if culturally appropriate and recorded where relevant  
- Anything above a modest threshold (set by the Legal Board) must be declared  
- Gifts must never be accepted from parties seeking a decision, contract, or preferential access  

## Recordkeeping and transparency
### Authoritative record (restricted)
Blu-H maintains a **Conflict of Interest Register** as part of its governance registers. This authoritative register is stored in Blu-H’s **official records system** (restricted access) and is the source of truth for Board assurance, audits, and due diligence.

GitHub supports drafting and controlled publication, but **does not replace statutory records** (e.g., signed minutes, formal resolutions, and controlled registers).

### Publishable transparency summary (public)
In line with Blu-H’s transparency-first approach, Blu-H may publish:
- this **Conflict of Interest Policy**, and  
- a **publishable COI summary** (high-level only)

The publishable summary must **exclude personal data and security-sensitive information** and should be limited to what’s necessary to disclose **material interests** relevant to governance decisions.

### Minutes requirements
The Legal Board ensures that minutes record:
- what was declared  
- who was recused  
- what mitigation was applied  
- the decision outcome  

### Review cadence
The Legal Board reviews the COI Register at least **quarterly** (and additionally when a material conflict arises in a high-risk decision).

## Breaches and enforcement
Failure to disclose or comply with this policy may result in:
- Removal from a decision-making process  
- Formal warning  
- Suspension or termination of an advisory/volunteer role  
- Escalation to the Legal Board for further action  

Good-faith reporting of concerns will not result in retaliation.

## Sign-off
Approved by the Legal Board on **[YYYY-MM-DD]**.

## Next steps
This policy should be drafted, reviewed, and approved by the Legal Board before Blu-H:
- Receives external funding  
- Enters formal partnerships  
- Procures significant services or technology  
- Appoints additional board or advisory members  
- Expands operations in higher-risk or disaster-affected contexts
