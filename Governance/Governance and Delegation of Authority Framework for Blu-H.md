# Governance and Delegation of Authority Framework for Blu-H

**Effective Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Status:** DRAFT (Subject to Legal Board Approval)

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the structural governance and financial authority for Blu-H, a scientific non-profit organization. [cite_start]To ensure compliance with Luxembourgish ASBL law and EU transparency standards, Blu-H operates under a dual-layer system: a **Legal Board** (governance and fiduciary oversight) and **Hired Staff** (technical and operational execution)[cite: 1].

[cite_start]The core principle of this framework is that while the Board delegates daily management to professional staff, it retains ultimate authority over the organization’s mission, budget, and senior appointments[cite: 1]. [cite_start]Specifically, the Executive Director and Science Lead are restricted to approving expenses only for projects previously vetted and funded by the Board[cite: 1].

## I. Blu-H Delegation of Authority (Financial & Operational Thresholds)

[cite_start]This framework establishes the mandatory boundaries for spending and decision-making for Blu-H[cite: 1].

| Category | Legal Board (inc. President) | Hired Staff (ED & Science Lead) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Focus** | Governance, Fiduciary Duty & Strategy | Technical Execution & Operations |
| **Hiring Power** | Appoints/Hires ED and Science Lead | Recruits Project Staff & Contractors |
| **Financial Authority** | Approves Annual Operating Budget | Approves project-specific expenses ONLY |
| **Programmatic Rule** | Final Authorization of New Projects | Technical Design & Delivery |
| **Legal Status** | Primary Signatories (LBR Registered) | Operational Reporting & Execution |

### Specific Financial Controls
* [cite_start]**Project-Specific Expenses:** The Executive Director (ED) and Science Lead are authorized to approve expenses only if they are directly related to funded projects that have received formal prior approval from the Board[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**General Operating Expenses:** Any administrative or overhead costs outside of specific approved projects must be authorized by the President and Treasurer in alignment with the approved budget[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Significant Commitments:** Any unbudgeted expense or contract exceeding standard operational limits requires a formal Board resolution and dual signatures[cite: 1].

## II. Blu-H Organizational Overview: Governance vs. Management

[cite_start]In accordance with Luxembourg ASBL regulations, the **Legal Board** (*Conseil d'administration*) provides the mandate and oversight, while the **Hired Staff** (*Direction*) provides specialized labor[cite: 1].

### 1. The Legal Board (Governance & Appointment Power)
[cite_start]The Legal Board is the supreme executive body of Blu-H, vested with ultimate authority over the organization’s legal, financial, and fiduciary standing[cite: 1].

#### Executive Officers
* [cite_start]**President:** Serves as the primary legal delegate and lead signatory for all contractual and banking obligations[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Treasurer:** Safeguards the organization’s fiscal integrity and ensures accounting compliance with Luxembourgish standards[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Secretary:** Official custodian of the Register of Members and corporate minutes; ensures regulatory filings with the RCS and RBE[cite: 1].

#### Legal Board Expansion & Composition
[cite_start]The Board may appoint **Members-at-Large** to provide specialized expertise (e.g., Legal, Technical, ESG)[cite: 1]. Expansion must adhere to:
* [cite_start]**Luxembourgish Statutory Law:** Law of 7 August 2023 regarding ASBLs[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**EU Transparency & AML Compliance:** "Know Your Customer" (KYC) protocols and RBE registration[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Non-Profit Governance Standards:** Consistency with organizational Bylaws (*Statuts*)[cite: 1].

### 2. Hired Staff (Technical & Operational Management)
[cite_start]Staff roles are professional positions accountable to the Board[cite: 1]:
* [cite_start]**Executive Director (ED):** Manages the administrative engine (HR, recruitment, workflows)[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Science Lead:** Directs scientific strategy and manages technical research recruitment[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Technical & Program Staff:** Responsible for field work and execution of Board-approved projects[cite: 1].

## III. Formal Policy: Delegation of Authority

### 1. Purpose and Scope
[cite_start]This policy facilitates efficient operations while maintaining rigorous oversight to protect Blu-H assets in accordance with EU non-profit transparency regulations[cite: 1].

### 2. Core Governance Controls
* [cite_start]**No Self-Approval & Conflict of Interest (COI):** No individual may approve their own expenses[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Separation of Duties:** No single individual shall have total control over a financial transaction from initiation to recording[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Anti-Structuring Rule:** Transactions may not be split to bypass thresholds[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Dual Signatures:** Every binding legal contract or financial disbursement requires two separate authorized signatures[cite: 1].

### 3. Financial Approval Thresholds
| Transaction Value | Approval Authority | Mandate Requirements |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Project-Specific Costs** | ED or Science Lead | Limited strictly to Board-approved, funded projects |
| **Up to €2,000** | President + Treasurer | Dual signatures required; must align with budget |
| **Over €2,000** | Majority of the Legal Board | Requires formal Board resolution and dual signatures |

### 4. Operational Delegations
* [cite_start]**Strategy:** New program activations require Legal Board approval[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Human Resources:** All final employment contracts must be ratified by the Legal Board[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Independence:** ED/Science Lead roles are strictly distinct from Legal Board positions[cite: 1].
