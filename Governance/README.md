# Governance Documents

This folder contains **core governance documents** that describe **how Blu-H ASBL is
governed, overseen, and held accountable**.

These documents define roles, authority, decision-making structures, and formal
governance arrangements.

---

## Purpose of This Folder

The purpose of the `/governance` folder is to:

- Describe the structure and responsibilities of Blu-H’s **Legal Board**
- Clarify roles, authority, and boundaries
- Record formal governance frameworks and instruments
- Support continuity, accountability, and institutional memory

These documents answer the question:

> **“How is Blu-H governed?”**

## Why Governance Is Separate from Policy

Blu-H maintains a clear distinction between **governance** and **policy**:

### Governance documents:
- Define **authority and responsibility**
- Describe **who decides what**
- Establish oversight and accountability
- Change infrequently
- Require formal consideration by the Legal Board

Examples include:
- Legal Board Charter
- Delegation of Authority
- Conflict of Interest framework
- Decision records

---

### Policy documents (stored separately):
- Describe **how Blu-H behaves or operates responsibly**
- Apply across the organisation
- May evolve more frequently as context changes
- Support ethical, safeguarding, and compliance expectations

Policies answer the question:

> **“How does Blu-H act responsibly?”**

---

## Relationship to the Policies Folder

- Governance documents set the **framework**
- Policies operate **within that framework**

Separating these materials helps ensure:
- Clarity of purpose
- Appropriate review and approval processes
- Reduced risk of confusion between authority and behaviour
- Easier review by external stakeholders
