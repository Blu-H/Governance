**Effective Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Status:** DRAFT (Subject to Legal Board Approval)  
**Source Document:** [Google Doc Reference](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wgw9FXRsnLo96q5EmsSTGJUVAIMJoylDMWEdRNUjVhw/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.cuxsnqfiifqx)

## Executive Summary

This document defines the structural governance and financial authority for Blu-H, a scientific non-profit organization. To ensure compliance with Luxembourgish ASBL law and EU transparency standards, Blu-H operates under a dual-layer system: a **Legal Board** (governance and fiduciary oversight) and **Hired Staff** (technical and operational execution).

The core principle of this framework is that while the Board delegates daily management to professional staff, it retains ultimate authority over the organization’s mission, budget, and senior appointments. Specifically, the Executive Director and Science Lead are restricted to approving expenses only for projects previously vetted and funded by the Board.

## I. Blu-H Delegation of Authority (Financial & Operational Thresholds)

This framework establishes the mandatory boundaries for spending and decision-making for Blu-H.

| Category | Legal Board (inc. President) | Hired Staff (ED & Science Lead) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Focus** | Governance, Fiduciary Duty & Strategy | Technical Execution & Operations |
| **Hiring Power** | Appoints/Hires ED and Science Lead | Recruits Project Staff & Contractors |
| **Financial Authority** | Approves Annual Operating Budget | Approves project-specific expenses ONLY |
| **Programmatic Rule** | Final Authorization of New Projects | Technical Design & Delivery |
| **Legal Status** | Primary Signatories (LBR Registered) | Operational Reporting & Execution |

### Specific Financial Controls
* **Project-Specific Expenses:** The Executive Director (ED) and Science Lead are authorized to approve expenses only if they are directly related to funded projects that have received formal prior approval from the Board.
* **General Operating Expenses:** Any administrative or overhead costs outside of specific approved projects must be authorized by the President and Treasurer in alignment with the approved budget.
* **Significant Commitments:** Any unbudgeted expense or contract exceeding standard operational limits requires a formal Board resolution and dual signatures.

## II. Blu-H Organizational Overview: Governance vs. Management

In accordance with Luxembourg ASBL regulations, the **Legal Board** (*Conseil d'administration*) provides the mandate and oversight, while the **Hired Staff** (*Direction*) provides specialized labor.

### 1. The Legal Board (Governance & Appointment Power)
The Legal Board is the supreme executive body of Blu-H, vested with ultimate authority over the organization’s legal, financial, and fiduciary standing.

#### Executive Officers
* **President:** Serves as the primary legal delegate and lead signatory for all contractual and banking obligations.
* **Treasurer:** Safeguards the organization’s fiscal integrity and ensures accounting compliance with Luxembourgish standards.
* **Secretary:** Official custodian of the Register of Members and corporate minutes; ensures regulatory filings with the RCS and RBE.

#### Legal Board Expansion & Composition
The Board may appoint **Members-at-Large** to provide specialized expertise (e.g., Legal, Technical, ESG). Expansion must adhere to:
* **Luxembourgish Statutory Law:** Law of 7 August 2023 regarding ASBLs.
* **EU Transparency & AML Compliance:** "Know Your Customer" (KYC) protocols and RBE registration.
* **Non-Profit Governance Standards:** Consistency with organizational Bylaws (*Statuts*).

### 2. Hired Staff (Technical & Operational Management)
Staff roles are professional positions accountable to the Board:
* **Executive Director (ED):** Manages the administrative engine (HR, recruitment, workflows).
* **Science Lead:** Directs scientific strategy and manages technical research recruitment.
* **Technical & Program Staff:** Responsible for field work and execution of Board-approved projects.

## III. Formal Policy: Delegation of Authority

### 1. Purpose and Scope
This policy facilitates efficient operations while maintaining rigorous oversight to protect Blu-H assets in accordance with EU non-profit transparency regulations.

### 2. Core Governance Controls
* **No Self-Approval & Conflict of Interest (COI):** No individual may approve their own expenses.
* **Separation of Duties:** No single individual shall have total control over a financial transaction from initiation to recording.
* **Anti-Structuring Rule:** Transactions may not be split to bypass thresholds.
* **Dual Signatures:** Every binding legal contract or financial disbursement requires two separate authorized signatures.

### 3. Financial Approval Thresholds
| Transaction Value | Approval Authority | Mandate Requirements |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Project-Specific Costs** | ED or Science Lead | Limited strictly to Board-approved, funded projects |
| **Up to €xxxx** | President + Treasurer | Dual signatures required; must align with budget |
| **Over €xxxx** | Majority of the Legal Board | Requires formal Board resolution and dual signatures |

### 4. Operational Delegations
* **Strategy:** New program activations require Legal Board approval.
* **Human Resources:** All final employment contracts must be ratified by the Legal Board.
* **Independence:** ED/Science Lead roles are strictly distinct from Legal Board positions.
