**Effective Date:** (date)  
**Status:** DRAFT (Subject to Legal Board Approval)  
**Owner:** Legal Board  
**Last updated:** 2 February 2026

## Executive Summary

This document defines the structural governance and financial authority for Blu-H, a scientific non-profit organization. To ensure compliance with Luxembourgish ASBL law and EU transparency standards, Blu-H operates under a dual-layer system: a Legal Board (governance and fiduciary oversight) and Hired Staff (technical and operational execution).

The core principle of this framework is that while the Board delegates daily management to professional staff, it retains ultimate authority over the organization’s mission, budget, and senior appointments. Specifically, the Executive Director and Science Lead are restricted to approving expenses only for projects previously vetted and funded by the Board, ensuring rigorous fiscal control and alignment with the organization’s scientific objectives.

## I. Blu-H Delegation of Authority (Financial & Operational Thresholds)

This framework establishes the mandatory boundaries for spending and decision-making for Blu-H.

| Category | Legal Board (inc. President) | Hired Staff (ED & Science Lead) |
|---|---|---|
| Primary Focus | Governance, Fiduciary Duty & Strategy | Technical Execution & Operations |
| Hiring Power | Appoints/Hires ED and Science Lead | Recruits Project Staff & Contractors |
| Financial Authority | Approves Annual Operating Budget | Approves project-specific expenses ONLY |
| Programmatic Rule | Final Authorization of New Projects | Technical Design & Delivery |
| Legal Status | Primary Signatories (LBR Registered) | Operational Reporting & Execution |

### Specific Financial Controls

- **Project-Specific Expenses:** The Executive Director (ED) and Science Lead are authorized to approve expenses only if they are directly related to funded projects that have received formal prior approval from the Board.
- **General Operating Expenses:** Any administrative or overhead costs outside of specific approved projects must be authorized by the President and Treasurer in alignment with the approved budget.
- **Significant Commitments:** Any unbudgeted expense or contract exceeding standard operational limits requires a formal Board resolution and dual signatures.

## II. Blu-H Organizational Overview: Governance vs. Management

In accordance with Luxembourg ASBL regulations, the Legal Board (*Conseil d'administration*) provides the mandate and oversight, while the Hired Staff (*Direction*) provides specialized labor.

### 1. The Legal Board (Governance & Appointment Power)

The Legal Board is the supreme executive body of Blu-H, vested with ultimate authority over the organization’s legal, financial, and fiduciary standing.

#### Executive Officers

- **President:** Serves as the primary legal delegate and lead signatory for all contractual and banking obligations. The President ensures that executive leadership and operational actions remain strictly aligned with the Board’s strategic vision.
- **Treasurer:** Safeguards the organization’s fiscal integrity. The Treasurer is responsible for ensuring accounting compliance with Luxembourgish standards, overseeing statutory financial filings, and managing long-term fiscal health.
- **Secretary:** Acts as the official custodian of the Register of Members and corporate minutes. The Secretary ensures all regulatory filings—specifically with the RCS and RBE—are executed accurately and timely to maintain the organization’s good standing.

#### Legal Board Expansion & Composition

To maintain a high standard of governance, the Board may appoint Additional Board Members (Members-at-Large) to provide specialized expertise in areas such as Legal Affairs, Technical Innovation, or ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) oversight.

The expansion of the Legal Board is a formal process that must be conducted in strict accordance with the following regulatory frameworks:

- **Luxembourgish Statutory Law:** All appointments must adhere to the Law of 7 August 2023 regarding ASBLs and Foundations. This includes the mandatory filing and publication of director appointments in the Recueil Électronique des Sociétés et Associations (RESA) within one month of the effective date.
- **EU Transparency & AML Compliance:** New appointees must fulfill "Know Your Customer" (KYC) protocols for institutional banking and be registered with the Registre des Bénéficiaires Effectifs (RBE) per EU Directive 2018/843. This ensures total transparency regarding individuals holding significant influence or control.
- **Non-Profit Governance Standards:** Growth must remain consistent with the organization’s Bylaws (Statuts). Members must be formally ratified by the General Assembly or co-opted by the Board (where permitted), ensuring a balanced distribution of power that prevents any single interest group from gaining disproportionate control.

#### Primary Authorities

- **Fiduciary Oversight:** Final approval of annual budgets, financial statements, and high-level resource allocation.
- **Executive Leadership:** Exclusive authority over the appointment, performance review, and dismissal of senior management (e.g., Executive Director, Science Lead).
- **Strategic Authorization:** Final sign-off on all major programs and initiatives to ensure mission alignment and preservation of "non-profit" legal status.
- **Jurisdictional Integrity:** Ensuring the organizational structure evolves in compliance with the legal requirements of the European Economic Area (EEA).

### 2. Operations Staff (Technical & Operational Management)

Staff roles are professional positions hired to perform day-to-day work; they are accountable to the Board but maintain operational independence.

- **Executive Director (ED):** A hired professional (non-Board member). Manages the administrative engine, including HR, general recruitment, membership, income and operational workflows.
- **Science Lead:** A hired technical expert. Directs scientific strategy, ensures research integrity, and manages specialized recruitment of technical researchers.
- **Operational & Program Staff:** Responsible for field work and execution of Board-approved projects.

## III. Formal Policy: Delegation of Authority

### 1. Purpose and Scope

This policy facilitates efficient operations while maintaining rigorous oversight to protect Blu-H assets in accordance with EU non-profit transparency regulations.

### 2. Core Governance Controls

- **No Self-Approval & Conflict of Interest (COI):** In compliance with EU transparency standards, no individual may approve their own expenses. All COIs must be disclosed to the Secretary.
- **Separation of Duties:** No single individual shall have total control over a financial transaction from initiation to recording.
- **Anti-Structuring Rule:** Transactions may not be split to bypass thresholds.
- **Dual Signatures:** Every binding legal contract or financial disbursement requires two separate authorized signatures to be legally valid.

### 3. Financial Spending Approval Thresholds (REDACTED)

Authority to commit Blu-H to financial obligations is delegated as follows:

| Transaction Value | Approval Authority | Mandate Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| Project-Specific Costs | Executive Director or Science Lead | Limited strictly to Board-approved, funded projects. |
| **€[REDACTED]** | President + Treasurer | Dual signatures required; must align with approved budget. |
| **Over €[REDACTED]** | Majority of the Legal Board | Requires formal Board resolution and dual signatures. |

### 4. Operational Delegations

- **4.1 Strategy:** New program activations require Legal Board approval. Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) must be reviewed with the Advisory Board, but final execution rests with the Legal Board.
- **4.2 Human Resources:** While the ED and Science Lead manage recruitment, all final employment contracts and contractor agreements must be ratified by the Legal Board to be legally binding.
- **4.3 Independence:** The ED/Science Lead roles are strictly distinct from Legal Board positions to ensure a check-and-balance system.
