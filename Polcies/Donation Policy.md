Organisation: Blu-H ASBL (Luxembourg)
Status: Draft
Applies to: Blu-H ASBL
Owner: Legal Board 
Last updated: 21 January 2026
Next review: 30 June 2026

1. Purpose

Blu-H welcomes donations that support its public-interest mission and scientific work. This Donation Acceptance Policy sets out Blu-H’s principles and approach to accepting donations and gifts in a way that protects our independence, integrity, and the people and communities affected by our work.

This is a public policy. Detailed internal controls (screening steps, record formats, accounting workflow, and internal approval routing) are maintained in internal procedures.

2. Scope

This policy applies to all donations and gifts received by Blu-H, including:
	•	Cash donations (e.g., bank transfer, online payment processor)
	•	In-kind donations (e.g., equipment, software, cloud credits, data, professional services)
	•	Restricted and unrestricted donations
	•	Donations and bequests (legacies) via estates or wills
	•	Donations received directly by Blu-H or via a third party acting on Blu-H’s behalf

3. Donation Acceptance Principles

Blu-H is guided by the following principles:
	•	Mission alignment
	•	Independence and impartiality
	•	Integrity (including scientific integrity)
	•	Transparency and accountability
	•	Legality and regulatory compliance
	•	Protection of people and communities (do no harm)
	•	Privacy and responsible data handling

4. What Blu-H Accepts

Blu-H may accept:
	•	Unrestricted donations that support operations and mission delivery
	•	Restricted donations for a clear, lawful, and feasible purpose agreed with the donor
	•	In-kind donations where permitted use, ownership/rights, and conditions are clear
	•	Multi-year pledges where terms are clear and do not compromise Blu-H’s independence

Blu-H may seek clarification or additional documentation from donors when needed to meet legal, banking, audit, or due diligence requirements.

5. What Blu-H Will Not Accept (Minimum)

Blu-H will not accept donations that:
	•	Are illegal or reasonably suspected to be linked to fraud, money laundering, sanctions evasion, or other criminal activity
	•	Compromise Blu-H’s independence, impartiality, or governance responsibilities
	•	Require suppression, manipulation, or improper control of scientific methods, results, or communications
	•	Create unacceptable safeguarding, security, or “do no harm” risks for people or communities
	•	Require Blu-H to take on disproportionate operational, legal, or reputational risk
	•	Cannot be properly recorded, receipted, and reconciled to an audit-ready standard
	•	Require external authorisation that is not obtained (see Section 6)

6. Luxembourg Legal and Statutory Considerations (High-Level)

Blu-H operates under Luxembourg rules applicable to ASBLs. In particular:
	•	Certain donations and bequests above statutory thresholds may require external authorisation by the competent Luxembourg authority (commonly the Ministry of Justice) before they are fully effective.
	•	Where authorisation or enhanced due diligence is required, Blu-H may only proceed in a manner consistent with that process, including the ability to identify the donor where necessary.

Blu-H will decline or defer acceptance where legal requirements cannot be met.

7. Restricted Donations

Blu-H may accept restricted donations if:
	•	The restriction is clear, lawful, and feasible
	•	The restriction does not compromise independence, integrity, or safety
	•	Blu-H can reasonably track and apply the funds to the intended purpose

Blu-H may decline restricted donations if restrictions are impractical, create disproportionate risk, or imply commitments Blu-H cannot responsibly deliver.

8. In-Kind Donations

Blu-H may accept in-kind donations where:
	•	Ownership, rights, and permitted use are clear (including any licensing terms)
	•	The donation is safe and lawful to receive and use
	•	The donation does not create unacceptable security, compliance, or operational burden
	•	Any valuation required for accounting can be supported by reasonable evidence

Examples may include: cloud credits, software licences, equipment, pro bono professional services, or datasets.

9. Donor Recognition and Privacy

Blu-H treats donor information as confidential by default.
	•	Blu-H may acknowledge donors publicly only with donor consent and where doing so does not create safety, privacy, or ethical concerns.
	•	Blu-H will not publish donor personal data, payment details, banking details, or screening notes in public repositories (including GitHub).

10. Reporting Concerns

Concerns about donation integrity, undue influence, or inappropriate conditions can be reported confidentially to:
	•	Email: info@blu-h.org

No retaliation will occur for good-faith reporting.

11. Records and Accountability

Blu-H maintains appropriate internal records of donations, including:
	•	Basic donation details (date, amount/value, type, restrictions if any)
	•	Evidence supporting receipt and any terms/conditions
	•	Records required for reconciliation, accounting, and reporting

Internal donation workflows and registers are maintained outside public repositories.

12. Conflicts of Interest

Actual or perceived conflicts of interest related to donors or donation decisions must be declared and managed in accordance with Blu-H’s conflict-of-interest rules.

13. Review

This policy will be reviewed periodically and updated as Blu-H’s activities evolve and as legal, banking, or regulatory requirements change.
