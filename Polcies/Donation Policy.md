---

## 3. Core principles

Blu-H applies the following principles to donations:

1. **Mission alignment:** Donations must support Blu-H’s statutory purpose and activities.  [oai_citation:2‡Blu-H_Statutes_EN_Informational.pdf](file-service://file-6KLn3aZV4SFvMMWwUgwejM)  
2. **Independence:** Blu-H remains politically, ideologically, and religiously independent; donations must not compromise this independence.  [oai_citation:3‡Blu-H_Statutes_EN_Informational.pdf](file-service://file-6KLn3aZV4SFvMMWwUgwejM)  
3. **Integrity and transparency:** We keep audit-ready records, apply proportionate checks, and use funds as agreed.  [oai_citation:4‡Blu-H_Donation_Acceptance_SOP_v1.2_DRAFT.docx](file-service://file-HNxbe415xMANFWa4AuWZ3U)  
4. **Do no harm:** We avoid accepting funds that create safeguarding, privacy, security, or reputational risks that are disproportionate to the benefit.  [oai_citation:5‡Blu-H_Safeguarding_Policy_Draft.docx](file-service://file-R1CffWzGcsCJspUHEWh4ms)  
5. **Data protection by design:** Donor personal data is handled in line with GDPR and is not published in public repositories.  [oai_citation:6‡Blu-H_Legal_Board_Handbook_GitHub_v0.3.docx](file-service://file-PxWPZWsWUGwsa868iarpEL)

## 4. What Blu-H accepts

Blu-H may accept:

- **Unrestricted donations** to support core operations and mission delivery  
- **Restricted donations** for a clearly defined purpose (e.g., a pilot, capacity building, cloud processing), where the restriction is feasible and does not compromise independence or safety  
- **In-kind donations** (e.g., cloud credits, software licences, pro bono professional services), where valuation and usage conditions are clear  
- **Anonymous donations only where lawful and low-risk** (and where Blu-H can still meet its legal obligations—see Section 6)  [oai_citation:7‡mj.gouvernement.lu](https://mj.gouvernement.lu/fr/service-citoyens/asbl.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

---

## 5. What Blu-H does not accept

Blu-H will not accept donations that:

- Are **illegal**, or reasonably suspected to be proceeds of crime or linked to sanctions evasion  
- Require Blu-H to take actions that conflict with our **mission, independence, or ethics**  [oai_citation:8‡Blu-H_Statutes_EN_Informational.pdf](file-service://file-6KLn3aZV4SFvMMWwUgwejM)  
- Include conditions that would **distort scientific integrity**, suppress findings, or create improper influence over outputs  
- Require Blu-H to publish or share data in ways that create unacceptable **privacy/safeguarding/security risk**  [oai_citation:9‡Blu-H_Legal_Board_Handbook_GitHub_v0.3.docx](file-service://file-PxWPZWsWUGwsa868iarpEL)  
- Cannot be accepted because required **Luxembourg legal authorisation** is not granted (see Section 6)  [oai_citation:10‡Guichet.public.lu](https://guichet.public.lu/en/entreprises/creation-developpement/forme-juridique/fondations/approbation-dons-legs-asbl-fondation.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- Cannot be properly receipted, recorded, or reconciled to an acceptable audit standard  [oai_citation:11‡Blu-H_Donation_Acceptance_SOP_v1.2_DRAFT.docx](file-service://file-HNxbe415xMANFWa4AuWZ3U)

## 6. Luxembourg legal and statutory considerations

### 6.1 Minister of Justice authorisation (donations/bequests > EUR 30,000)

Under Luxembourg rules, **any donation or bequest to an ASBL exceeding EUR 30,000** must be authorised by a decree of the **Minister of Justice**.  [oai_citation:12‡Guichet.public.lu](https://guichet.public.lu/en/entreprises/creation-developpement/forme-juridique/fondations/approbation-dons-legs-asbl-fondation.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

- Donations may be **provisionally accepted pending approval**, but only become effective once authorisation is granted.  [oai_citation:13‡Guichet.public.lu](https://guichet.public.lu/en/entreprises/creation-developpement/forme-juridique/fondations/fondations.html/_fax_%28%2B352%2926428555?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Authorisation will not be granted if the donor’s identity cannot be established.**  [oai_citation:14‡mj.gouvernement.lu](https://mj.gouvernement.lu/fr/service-citoyens/asbl.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

### 6.2 Statutory alignment (Blu-H Articles)

Blu-H uses funds to pursue its statutory purpose and operates with political/ideological/religious independence.  [oai_citation:15‡Blu-H_Statutes_EN_Informational.pdf](file-service://file-6KLn3aZV4SFvMMWwUgwejM)  

**Membership fees:** Blu-H’s statutes cap the annual membership fee (and treat any excess contribution as a donation). This policy applies to those “excess” amounts as well.  [oai_citation:16‡RESA_2025_202.553.pdf](file-service://file-StVS2mgFtKTZothcR2Tihh)  

---

## 7. Restricted vs unrestricted gifts

- **Unrestricted**: Blu-H allocates the funds where the need is greatest to advance the mission.  
- **Restricted**: Blu-H uses the funds only for the agreed purpose, tracks them appropriately, and reports as reasonably agreed with the donor.  [oai_citation:17‡Blu-H_Donation_Acceptance_SOP_v1.2_DRAFT.docx](file-service://file-HNxbe415xMANFWa4AuWZ3U)  

Blu-H may decline restricted gifts if the restriction is not feasible, creates disproportionate risk, or implies commitments Blu-H cannot responsibly deliver.

---

## 8. Donor privacy, publicity, and GitHub publication

- Blu-H is GDPR-aware and treats donor information as non-public by default.  [oai_citation:18‡Blu-H_Legal_Board_Handbook_GitHub_v0.3.docx](file-service://file-PxWPZWsWUGwsa868iarpEL)  
- Blu-H will not publish donor personal data, payment details, banking details, or screening notes on GitHub (even in private repos, as a rule).  [oai_citation:19‡Blu-H_Legal_Board_Handbook_GitHub_v0.3.docx](file-service://file-PxWPZWsWUGwsa868iarpEL)  
- Where donors request public acknowledgement, Blu-H will only acknowledge to the extent agreed and appropriate (e.g., name and amount range), and only where it does not introduce safety or ethical concerns.

---

## 9. Recordkeeping and accountability

Blu-H maintains appropriate internal records for donations (register entries, supporting evidence, and accounting records) consistent with good governance and audit readiness.  [oai_citation:20‡Blu-H_Donation_Acceptance_SOP_v1.2_DRAFT.docx](file-service://file-HNxbe415xMANFWa4AuWZ3U)  

---

## 10. Exceptions

Any exceptions to this policy must be documented internally with a clear rationale and retained in Blu-H’s official records system (not public repositories).  [oai_citation:21‡Blu-H_Legal_Board_Handbook_GitHub_v0.3.docx](file-service://file-PxWPZWsWUGwsa868iarpEL)  

---

## 11. Review

This policy will be reviewed periodically and updated as Blu-H’s funding model and regulatory posture mature.  [oai_citation:22‡Blu-H_Fundraising_Strategy_2026-2028_v0.2.docx](file-service://file-54FW2q94ZMB53tD5gE2ZqG)
