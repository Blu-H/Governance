# Financial Controls & Expenses Policy
**Organisation:** Blu-H ASBL (Luxembourg)  
**Status:** DRAFT  
**Applies to:** Board members, staff, volunteers, contractors (where relevant)  
**Owner:** Legal Board (with Treasurer as operational owner)  
**Effective date:** (date)  
**Last updated:** (date)  
**Next review:** (date)

---

## 1. Purpose
This policy defines how Blu-H controls spending, approves expenses, processes payments, and reimburses individuals. It is designed to:
- protect Blu-H assets and reputation,
- ensure transparency and an auditable trail,
- prevent misuse, conflicts of interest, and fraud,
- ensure spending aligns with Board-approved budgets and Board-approved projects.

This policy works together with Blu-H’s **Delegation of Authority (DoA)** framework. If there is a conflict, the DoA prevails.

---

## 2. Scope
This policy covers:
- purchasing and supplier engagement,
- payment methods and approval rules,
- expense reimbursements (travel, meals, incidentals, home-office where applicable),
- subscriptions and recurring payments,
- documentation standards and record retention,
- exceptions and escalation.

This policy does **not** replace any donor/grant restrictions; restricted funds must follow the applicable agreement terms.

---

## 3. Core Financial Control Principles
1. **Budget discipline:** Spend must be within the approved operating budget or an approved project budget.
2. **Project-only rule for project spend:** Project costs must be attributable to a Board-approved project and coded accordingly.
3. **No self-approval:** No one may approve their own expenses or payments.
4. **Segregation of duties:** No single person should control a transaction end-to-end (request → approve → pay → record → reconcile).
5. **Anti-structuring:** Transactions must not be split to bypass approval thresholds.
6. **Dual authorisation:** Binding contracts and material payments require dual approval per DoA / bank rules.
7. **Audit trail:** Every payment and reimbursement must be supported by adequate documentation.
8. **Value-for-money:** Prefer competitive pricing and avoid non-essential spend.

---

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities
- **Legal Board:** ultimate fiduciary responsibility; approves annual budget; approves exceptions above DoA thresholds.
- **President:** authorised signatory; approves certain spend per DoA; ensures governance compliance.
- **Treasurer:** financial oversight; ensures controls, bookkeeping, reconciliations, and reporting; co-approver on relevant spend.
- **Executive Director (ED):** day-to-day operations; initiates purchases within delegated limits; ensures adherence to this policy.
- **Science Lead:** initiates and validates technical/project purchases within delegated limits; ensures scientific relevance and integrity.
- **Secretary:** ensures minutes/resolutions evidence authorisations; maintains governance records.
- **Finance Admin / Bookkeeper (if appointed):** processes invoices/expense claims; maintains records; prepares reconciliations.

> **Conflict of Interest:** Any actual or perceived conflict must be disclosed and the conflicted individual must be removed from approval and decision-making for that transaction.

---

## 5. Approval Rules (Summary)
All approvals follow the **DoA thresholds**. Where thresholds are not yet finalised, use:
- **Project costs:** approved only if tied to a Board-approved funded project and within that project’s approved budget line.
- **Operating costs:** must align with the annual operating budget.

**Approval matrix placeholders (to align with DoA):**
- Up to **€[DoA-1]**: (Role A + Role B) dual approval
- Above **€[DoA-1]**: Board approval / resolution + dual signature where required

**Additional mandatory approvals regardless of value:**
- New suppliers where due diligence is required (see Section 7)
- Any contract with reputational, data protection, or safeguarding implications
- Any transaction that is unusual, high-risk, or outside normal operations
- Any spending that creates a recurring commitment (subscriptions, retainers) beyond **[X] months**

---

## 6. Spend Controls
### 6.1 Permitted spending
Blu-H funds may be used only for legitimate organisational purposes, including:
- project delivery and scientific activities,
- essential operations and compliance,
- reasonable travel and meeting costs where directly linked to Blu-H work.

### 6.2 Prohibited or restricted spending
Unless explicitly approved by the Legal Board:
- personal expenses not directly related to Blu-H work,
- cash gifts, political donations, or lobbying spend,
- alcohol or entertainment as a primary purpose (meals may be allowable when incidental and reasonable),
- fines and penalties (unless exceptional circumstances with Board visibility),
- “split” purchases to avoid approvals.

### 6.3 Procurement expectations
- Seek **best value**: for material purchases, obtain **2–3 quotes** where practical.
- Avoid sole-source unless justified (unique capability, urgency, continuity, IP/security constraints).
- Use preferred/approved suppliers where available.

---

## 7. Supplier Due Diligence 
Before onboarding a new supplier (especially for services, data, software, consulting, or field work):
- confirm legal entity and payment details,
- confirm scope, deliverables, pricing, and ownership/IP terms (where relevant),
- confirm compliance posture where needed (GDPR/data handling, security),
- check sanctions/high-risk jurisdictions where relevant,
- ensure a written agreement for material engagements.

---

## 8. Payment Methods and Controls
### 8.1 Approved payment methods (preferred order)
1. **Bank transfer** (preferred for invoices and contracts)
2. **Card payment** (only where necessary for online suppliers or travel)
3. **Payment platforms** (e.g., Stripe for donations; controlled access for payouts)

**Cash payments** should be avoided. If petty cash is required, it must be explicitly authorised, capped, and reconciled monthly.

### 8.2 Bank account controls
- Bank account access must be limited to authorised signatories.
- Dual authorisation should be enabled where possible.
- Changes to bank mandates/signatories require Board decision and documented evidence.

### 8.3 Card controls (if used)
- Named cards only; no shared cards unless unavoidable and tightly controlled.
- Monthly limits and merchant category restrictions where feasible.
- Receipts required for every card transaction.
- Lost/stolen cards must be reported immediately and cancelled.

---

## 9. Invoice Processing and Payment Workflow
### 9.1 Standard workflow
1. **Request / Purchase initiation**  
   - Requestor confirms budget availability and correct project/operating code.
2. **Approval**  
   - Approver verifies: legitimacy, budget line, value-for-money, and DoA threshold compliance.
3. **Invoice receipt & validation**  
   - Invoice must include supplier details, date, description, and bank/payment details.
   - Validate delivery/performance (goods received / services confirmed).
4. **Payment preparation**  
   - Finance Admin/ED prepares payment pack: invoice, approval evidence, coding, and supporting documents.
5. **Payment authorisation**  
   - Dual approval/signature as required.
6. **Recording & filing**  
   - Record in accounting system with correct coding (project, restriction, grant/donor tags).
7. **Reconciliation**  
   - Bank and card reconciled monthly; exceptions investigated promptly.

### 9.2 Required documentation (“payment pack”)
- Invoice (or equivalent receipt)
- Evidence of approval (email, system approval, or signed form)
- Proof of delivery/performance (where relevant)
- Correct coding (project/operating; restricted/unrestricted)
- For contracts: signed agreement and relevant Board resolution if required
