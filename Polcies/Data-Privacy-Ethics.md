**Applies to:** Blu-H ASBL  
**Owner:** Board of Directors  
**Last updated:** 20 December 2025  
**Next review:** 30 June 2026

## 1. Purpose

Blu-H uses satellite data, earth observation, modelling, and related information to
support flood early warning, situational awareness, and humanitarian decision-making.

This policy sets out Blu-H’s principles and approach to the **ethical, responsible, and
safe use of data**, with particular attention to disaster-affected and vulnerable
contexts.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- Environmental and geospatial data (e.g. water levels, rainfall, flooding extent)
- Satellite and earth observation imagery
- Model outputs, maps, alerts, and derived products
- Data collected, processed, or shared by Blu-H or its partners
- Digital and remote data interactions related to Blu-H activities

This policy complements Blu-H’s **Safeguarding Policy**.

---

## 3. Types of Data Used

Blu-H primarily works with **environmental and physical data**, including:

- Satellite imagery and remote sensing products  
- Rainfall, water level, and hydrological data  
- Flood extent, duration, and impact indicators  
- Modelled forecasts and risk assessments  

Blu-H seeks to **minimise the collection or use of personal data**. Where personal or
community-linked data is unavoidable, additional safeguards apply.

---

## 4. Core Data Ethics Principles

Blu-H is guided by the following principles:

### Do No Harm
Data use must not increase risk, vulnerability, or harm to individuals or communities,
especially in disaster or crisis contexts.

### Purpose Limitation
Data is collected and used only for clearly defined, mission-aligned humanitarian or
public-interest purposes.

### Proportionality
Data collection and processing are proportionate to the intended benefit and risk.

### Safety Over Openness
Transparency is valued, but safety takes priority. Data is not published where doing so
could expose people, infrastructure, or communities to harm.

### Accountability
Data decisions are subject to oversight and review.

---

## 5. Privacy and Personal Data

Blu-H aims to avoid collecting personal data.

Where personal data is processed:
- Processing is limited to what is strictly necessary
- Appropriate technical and organisational safeguards are applied
- Data protection requirements under applicable law (including GDPR) are respected
- Personal data is not published openly

---

## 6. Location, Risk, and Sensitive Contexts

Blu-H recognises that **location data and risk information can be sensitive**, particularly
during disasters.

Blu-H will:
- Avoid publishing precise locations where this could increase risk
- Aggregate, generalise, or delay data where appropriate
- Consider secondary and unintended uses of data products
- Apply additional caution in fragile, conflict-affected, or highly vulnerable contexts

---

## 7. Satellite Imagery and Earth Observation Ethics

When working with satellite imagery and EO data, Blu-H commits to:

- Using data sources responsibly and lawfully
- Respecting licensing and usage constraints
- Avoiding misinterpretation or over-claiming certainty
- Clearly communicating limitations, uncertainty, and assumptions

Derived products are reviewed to reduce the risk of misuse or misinterpretation.

---

## 8. Data Sharing and Publication

Blu-H may share data, analyses, or insights with partners to support humanitarian
preparedness and response.

Data sharing is guided by:
- Humanitarian purpose
- Risk assessment
- Partner trust and accountability
- Safeguarding considerations

Blu-H does not publish data where doing so could:
- Endanger individuals or communities
- Enable harmful targeting or exploitation
- Create security or safety risks

---

## 9. Use of Models, AI, and Automated Analysis

Where models, algorithms, or AI-assisted tools are used:

- Outputs are treated as decision-support, not decision-makers
- Human judgement and contextual understanding are retained
- Bias, uncertainty, and limitations are acknowledged
- Tools are used to support, not replace, humanitarian actors

---

## 10. Partner and Contributor Data

Blu-H may work with partners, citizen contributors, or local sources.

In such cases, Blu-H will:
- Respect voluntary participation
- Avoid placing contributors at risk
- Use contributed data responsibly and transparently
- Attribute contributions where appropriate and safe

---

## 11. Governance and Oversight

Data ethics and privacy considerations are overseen as part of Blu-H’s governance
framework.

Material data risks or ethical concerns may be escalated to the Board of Directors.

---

## 12. Review

This policy is reviewed periodically and updated as Blu-H’s activities, partnerships, and
technologies evolve.

---

## References and Alignment

This policy is informed by recognised good practice, including:

- UN OCHA – Data Responsibility Guidelines  
- Core Humanitarian Standard (CHS) on Quality and Accountability  
- EU data protection principles (GDPR)
