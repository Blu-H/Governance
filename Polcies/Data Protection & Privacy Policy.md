---

## 5. How We Collect Personal Data

We collect personal data when you:

- Apply for membership, renew, or update details  
- Donate, make payments, or request receipts  
- Subscribe to newsletters and updates  
- Register for or attend events  
- Contact us by email or via our website  
- Use our website (cookies/analytics where enabled)

---

## 6. Why We Process Personal Data (Lawful Bases)

Blu-H processes personal data only where a lawful basis applies, including:

- **Contract** (e.g., administering membership; delivering requested services or participation)
- **Legal obligation** (e.g., accounting obligations; statutory membership register duties)
- **Consent** (e.g., newsletters and non-essential cookies where required)
- **Legitimate interests** (e.g., essential communications, security, prevention of misuse, operational continuity)

Indicative purposes include:

- Managing membership and member communications (including AGM notices where applicable)
- Processing donations and payments; maintaining legally required financial records
- Sending newsletters (only where consent is given)
- Organising events and volunteer participation
- Operating and securing digital services (including fraud and abuse prevention)
- Governance administration (board/advisor administration as needed)

---

## 7. Membership Register and Governance Requirements

Blu-H maintains a **member register** and related governance records as required by applicable law and Blu-H’s statutes.

Where member consultation rights apply under the statutes, Blu-H implements access in a **proportionate, privacy-preserving** manner, limited to what is required and appropriate.

Blu-H does not treat email marketing tools or third-party platforms as the legal membership register.

---

## 8. Storage, Security, and Access Controls

Blu-H applies appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data, which may include:

- Least-privilege access controls and role-based permissions
- Multi-factor authentication where available
- Encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and secure storage practices
- Backups and operational logging
- Restricted access for authorised personnel and approved volunteers only

Blu-H’s default is **transparency where safe**, but personal data protection and safeguarding take priority.

---

## 9. Data Sharing and Service Providers

Blu-H does **not** sell personal data.

We may share personal data with trusted service providers acting as **processors** under Blu-H’s instructions, such as:

- Payment processors (only when you make a payment)
- Communications platforms (only as needed for communications you have opted into, or essential member notices)
- Hosting and infrastructure providers (for secure service delivery)
- Event tools (where used) strictly for event administration

Where required, Blu-H uses appropriate contractual safeguards (e.g., data processing agreements) and expects providers to comply with applicable data protection law.

We may also disclose personal data when required by law, or where necessary to protect vital interests.

---

## 10. Publication, Openness, and “What We Do Not Publish”

Blu-H may publish selected governance and technical materials to support transparency and accountability.

However, Blu-H does **not** publish:

- Member, donor, volunteer, or contributor personal data
- Safeguarding reports, allegations, case details, or survivor information
- Security-sensitive operational information (credentials, tokens, private endpoints)
- Information that could increase risk in fragile or disaster-affected contexts

If Blu-H uses public collaboration platforms (e.g., GitHub) for transparency, these are used in a way that **excludes personal and sensitive data** by design.

---

## 11. Retention

Blu-H retains personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described, including legal and governance obligations.

Indicative retention periods:

- Membership records: retained as required for governance and legal compliance
- Donation/financial records: retained as required for accounting obligations (often up to 10 years)
- Newsletter subscription data: retained until you unsubscribe (or earlier where applicable)
- Event registrations: typically retained for a limited period after the event (e.g., up to 2 years)

Where deletion is requested, Blu-H will comply where possible unless retention is legally required or necessary to establish/exercise/defend legal claims.

---

## 12. Cookies and Website Analytics

Blu-H’s website may use cookies and similar technologies for:

- Essential site functionality and security
- Basic performance monitoring
- Analytics (where enabled)

Where non-essential cookies are used, Blu-H will provide user controls (e.g., a cookie banner and preferences) and rely on consent where required.

---

## 13. International Transfers

Blu-H seeks to store and process personal data within the **European Economic Area (EEA)**.

If processing occurs outside the EEA, Blu-H uses appropriate safeguards such as:

- Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)
- Adequacy decisions where applicable
- Additional technical/contractual protections as appropriate

---

- Access to your personal data
- Rectification of inaccurate data
- Erasure (in certain circumstances)
- Restriction of processing

Blu-H aims to respond within **one month** (and may extend where legally permitted).

---

## 15. Safeguarding and Sensitive Reports

Safeguarding-related information is handled with heightened confidentiality and restricted access.

If you contact Blu-H to report a safeguarding concern, Blu-H will manage that information in line with its Safeguarding Policy and will never publish safeguarding case information.

---

## 16. Governance and Oversight

This policy is overseen as part of Blu-H’s governance framework.

Material data protection or privacy risks, incidents, or concerns may be escalated to the **Board of Directors**, and internal procedures may apply for higher-risk processing (e.g., project-specific assessments and partner controls).

---
