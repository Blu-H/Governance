## Governance Structure

Blu-H operates with a clear separation of responsibilities:

### Legal Board of Directors (Conseil d’administration)
- Statutory governing body under Luxembourg law  
- Holds fiduciary responsibility for the organisation  
- Approves strategy, budgets, and major commitments  
- Ensures legal and ethical compliance  

### Members and the General Assembly
- Blu-H has a **membership base** that forms the organisation’s General Assembly  
- Members provide democratic legitimacy for key reserved decisions (as defined in the statutes)  
- Membership supports the mission and long-term accountability of the organisation  

### Annual General Meeting (AGM)
- The **AGM** is the annual meeting of the General Assembly  
- It provides a formal moment for reviewing governance matters and recording key decisions  
- The AGM supports transparency, continuity, and accountability over time  

### Advisory Boards
- Non-fiduciary and non-executive  
- Provide scientific, technical, and strategic advice  
- Do not hold decision-making authority  
- Serve on a pro bono basis  

### Operational Management
- Responsible for execution of approved strategy and programmes  
- Operates within delegated authority approved by the Legal Board  
- Accountable to the Legal Board of Directors

## How Governance Decisions Are Made

Governance decisions are made in a documented and reviewable manner.

As a general principle:

- Significant governance, policy, or strategic decisions are proposed in writing  
- Proposals are reviewed by the appropriate governing body  
- Approved decisions are formally recorded and retained  

Decision records in this repository provide traceability and accountability.

The Blu-H GitHub organisation is jointly administered by multiple founders to reduce single-person risk and support continuity.

## GitHub Is Not the Legal Record

This repository supports transparency and collaboration, but it does **not** replace legal governance processes.

- Official legal authority comes from the association’s statutes and applicable law  
- Signed minutes, resolutions, and formal filings must be managed through Blu-H’s official records and required channels  
- GitHub drafts, discussions, and workflows are supporting tools, not a substitute for statutory decision-making or recordkeeping

## Transparency

Publishing governance documentation publicly reflects Blu-H’s commitment to:

- Good governance practice  
- Donor and partner confidence  
- Ethical and responsible operations  
- Long-term organisational resilience
